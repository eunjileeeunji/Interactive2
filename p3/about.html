        American Lebanese Painter & Writer <br>

      <p id="description">
        Etel Adnan began painting in the early 1960s. Widely known for her poetry, novels and plays, she moves fluidly between the disciplines 
        of writing and art and is a leading voice of contemporary Arab-American culture. A multi-linguist who has had a nomadic existence, 
        Adnan makes work that traverses cultures and disciplines, drawing its inspiration from a deep engagement with the world. Her elemental
        colour field compositions exude an intense energy. During her time in Sausalito, Adnan began to focus on the surrounding landscape, 
        in particular, Mount Tamalpais which was visible from the windows of her home. The mountain became an immutable reference point which 
        she drew incessantly, capturing its ever changing moods and dynamic at different times of day, in all seasons.
